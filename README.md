# Amazon Automation Part 2

Hey guys sorry for the delay with the video upload. Due to some work and I was not able to make the GTA 5 app work it took me a month to cover up for the next video, But we are back together for new innovations. So with a cup of coffee lets get started.  

SO guys this video is all about how we can search products and order by adding in cart. The code is explained and we have added small validations there. The validation is for making our life a bit easier. Some products are having buying options and unavailable status so we have to skip such products for now. You can add more code and use those products too but for now, I have skipped it. So, watch the full video and add your valuable comments.
